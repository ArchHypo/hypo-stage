# Walkthrough videos

Stable-named clips for the [Real usage walkthrough](../real-usage-walkthrough.md): `walkthrough-1-home.webm` … `walkthrough-6-delete.webm`.

Generated by running the E2E suite then:

```bash
node scripts/copy-walkthrough-videos.js
```

Or `yarn test:e2e:walkthrough` to run tests and copy in one go. Source recordings are in `e2e/e2e-videos/` (gitignored).
