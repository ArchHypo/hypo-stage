## Requirements

- **Backend plugin** — The HypoStage backend (`@internal/plugin-hypo-stage-backend`) must be installed in the same Backstage app and registered in `packages/backend/src/index.ts`. The backend provides the REST API and database used by this frontend.
- **API registration** — The app must register `HypoStageApiRef` in `packages/app/src/apis.ts` (or equivalent) with `HypoStageApiClient` so that the UI can call the backend. See the [main README – Step 3.2](https://github.com/ArchHypo/hypo-stage#32-register-the-frontend-api--in-packagesappsrcapits).
- **Backend running** — The Backstage backend must be running with a configured database (PostgreSQL or SQLite). Migrations run automatically on backend startup.

## Build, test and lint

From the **repository root** (parent of this directory), run:

```bash
# All plugins (recommended)
make build    # or: yarn build
make test     # or: yarn test
make lint     # or: yarn lint
```

From **this directory** only:

```bash
yarn install          # if not already installed from root
yarn build            # requires type declarations: run `yarn build` (or `yarn build:types`) from repo root first
yarn test
yarn lint
```

Building from this directory alone will fail until the root has been built at least once, because the Backstage CLI build expects TypeScript declaration output from the root `yarn build:types` step.

For full validation (deps, build, test, lint for both frontend and backend), see [Validating usage](https://github.com/ArchHypo/hypo-stage/blob/main/README.md#validating-usage) in the main README.

## What this package provides

### Pages (routed)

- **HypoStagePage** – Main list and dashboard (`/hypo-stage`)
- **CreateHypothesisPage** – Create hypothesis form
- **HypothesisPage** – Hypothesis detail and technical planning
- **EditHypothesisPage** – Edit hypothesis form

### Catalog integration

- **EntityHypothesesTab** – Tab on catalog entity pages showing hypotheses that reference the entity
- **useHypoStageTabEnabled()** – Whether the Hypo Stage tab is enabled (e.g. via feature flag)
- **HYPO_STAGE_FEATURE_FLAG** – Feature flag name: `'hypo-stage'`

### API

- **HypoStageApiRef**, **HypoStageApiClient** – Frontend API to call the HypoStage backend
- **GetHypothesesOptions** – Type for list filters (entityRef, team)

### Reusable components (for custom UIs)

- **HypothesisForm**, **HypothesisList** – Forms and list

## Installation into a Backstage app

1. Copy this `hypo-stage` directory into your app’s `plugins/` folder.
2. From the app root:

   ```bash
   yarn --cwd packages/app add @internal/plugin-hypo-stage
   ```

3. Add routes and sidebar entry (see [main README – Configure the frontend](https://github.com/ArchHypo/hypo-stage#step-2-configure-the-frontend)).
4. Register **HypoStageApiRef** in `packages/app/src/apis.ts` (see [main README – Configure APIs](https://github.com/ArchHypo/hypo-stage#32-register-the-frontend-api--in-packagesappsrcapits)).

Full installation and Docker usage are documented in the [repository README](https://github.com/ArchHypo/hypo-stage/blob/main/README.md).
